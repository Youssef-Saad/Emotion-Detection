# Emotion-Detection
I used data from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data and did Facial Emotion Recognition on FER2013 Dataset Using a Convolutional Neural Network. I used MobileNetV2 as it small, low-latency, low-power models parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use cases and haar cascade to identify faces in real-time.
